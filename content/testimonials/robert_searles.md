I spent 11 years of my life at University of Delaware obtaining my Bachelor’s Degree, Master’s Degree, and Doctorate. The best of those years were the nearly 3 years I had the pleasure of working with Prof. Sunita Chandrasekaran and the other students in her lab. She is smart, driven, and most importantly, she cares about her students. She pushes all of them to grow and learn, and she also cares about them on a personal level. She goes above and beyond to make sure that her students end up in places they want to be in their careers after leaving CRPL by leveraging all the connections she has made over the years in the field of HPC (which are extensive). In my case, I ended up working for my first-choice: NVIDIA.

CRPL is a collaborative, team-focused environment led by a person I can only describe as the ideal PhD advisor. All the other students I had the privilege of working with supported each other. There was always a healthy balance of constructive criticism and support that allowed us to help each other prepare our projects and presentations for the scrutiny they would face under peer review and at conferences without discouragement. My coworkers there made me better at what I do, and I hope I made them better at what they do too. If you’re considering pursuing a specialized education in HPC, CRPL is the place to do it.
