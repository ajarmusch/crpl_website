I got my PhD and Masters from the University of Delaware. During this time I had the opportunity to work at the CRPL research group for several years. I obtained my master’s degree guided by Sunita and supported by my peers at CRPL. It was through this time that I really understood that a good graduate education experience can only be achieved through excellent academic advisors that have the ability to form strongly bonded research groups. Being a good professor and being able to create a strong research group goes beyond scientific relevance, and it is accompanied by a set of human and interpersonal skills that are often overlooked. Sunita’s research group shines for its academic excellence, but above all, for its human talent.

As a student, it is critical to have someone that inspires you and pushes you forward to grow personally and professionally. That is exactly what I was able to find when working with professor Sunita and her students. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, part of the Department of Energy. Working for ECP with CRPL allowed me to learn and experience national laboratories, helping me decide a career path after graduation. Professor Sunita often emphasizes the importance of networking and outreach when being a student, allowing for the student to prepare themselves for life after graduation.
