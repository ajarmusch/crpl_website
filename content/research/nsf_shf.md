### SHF: PAW: Novel Functionality in Programming Models to Productively Abstract Wavefront Parallel Pattern  
  
**PI:** Sunita Chandrasekaran  
**Students:** Fabian Mora, Matt Leinhauser  
  
**Funding Agency:** National Science Foundation (NSF)  
  
**Duration:** 10/01/2018 – 09/30/2021  
  
**Project Summary:**  
The aim of this research project is to design novel high-level programming abstractions for complex parallel patterns in scientific applications as these patterns often require for the programmer to restructure the code thus spending hours to create a new codebase which can be both time-consuming and error-prone. To achieve this, we address the performance and portability questions at the algorithmic-level, programming framework-level and at the software design level. The studies are also suggestive of shortcomings in current programming models paving the way to developing novel insights towards high-level software abstractions for multi-use in different/diverse projects simultaneously.
