### OpenMP VV: A Testsuite to Validate and Verify OpenMP Features which is apart of the ECP SOLLVE project

**PI:** Sunita Chandrasekaran  
**Current Students** Thomas Huber, Nolan Baker, Kristina Holsapple, Jaydon Reap, Michael Carr  
**Past Students:** Jose Manuel Monsalve Diaz, Joshua Davis  
**Collaborators:**

* Oak Ridge National Lab (OLCF): Swaroop Pophale, David Bernholdt

**Funding Agency:** Department of Energy (Exascale Computing Project - SOLLVE)

**Project Summary:**
This projects aims to provide the OpenMP community, hardware vendors, and National Lab collaborators with an up-to-date OpenMP Validation and Verification test suite that aims to evaluate usability of various compilers that support the OpenMP specification. Every few years, the OpenMP ARB releases new versions of the specifcation. When this happens, there are a handful of new features (constructs, directives, clauses) that are added to the language. 

By creating tests for these new features as they are introduced, we are able to aid hardware vendors in the development of their implemenation, catch and report bugs for various compiler vendors, and create test cases for features in cases where no other test cases may exist.
