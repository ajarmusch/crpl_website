### Validation and Verification Suite for OpenMP Offloading

**PI:** Sunita Chandrasekaran  
**Students:** Josh Davis, Thomas Huber, Jose Diaz  
**Collaborators:** Oak Ridge National Lab: Swaroop Pophale, David Bernholdt, Oscar Hernandez

**Funding Agency:** ECP SOLLVE, DOE Oak Ridge National Laboratory   

**Duration:** 04/20/17 – 04/30/2023

**Project Summary:**  
This project is in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The project is funded for 1 year at a time and renewed upon successful deliverable of results. So far, the project has been renewed twice. The OpenMP testsuite project targets validation and verification of features of OpenMP offloading programming model (OpenMP 4.0 and onwards). For testing purposes, we use two major systems: Summit, world’s fastest super- computer housed in ORNL and Perlmutter housed in Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL). We test compilers from vendors including IBM, AMD, Intel, Clang/LLVM and GNU.
Frontier and El-Capitan are two Exascale architectures that are planned to be in place during the 2021-2022 time frame, in the US. In order to use these systems, we need mature and stable software. Application developers would need to use reliable software in order to migrate their codes to these novel platforms. This validation and verification project aims to address this major need by building a robust testsuite and infrastructure to stress test OpenMP offload- ing compilers, identify bugs that the vendors address, re-evaluate the newer versions of the compilers thus preparing robust and mature compiler implementations for the application developers to use.
